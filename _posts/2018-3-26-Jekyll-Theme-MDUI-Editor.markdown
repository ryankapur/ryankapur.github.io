Greetings stranger, professor, recruiter, classmate, friend, stalker, and/or aquaintance! Welcome to my first blog post.
* 
{:toc}

## What is this

1. First post of a WIP personal blog


## Why use a theme?

1. Save time 
2. This Jekyll theme is clean
3. I will learn Jekyll slowly, just by modifying this theme I've found slowly over time
4. Not everything needs to be built from scratch

## How can I replicate this blog?

[getting started w/ jekyll](https://github.com/themooserooster/getting-started-with-jekyll)

[this theme](https://blog.kejun.space/)

[friend's blog who inspired me to try out jekyll](emileechen.com/blog/webdev/2018/01/18/creating-a-custom-blog-with-jekyll/)

## Future thoughts
