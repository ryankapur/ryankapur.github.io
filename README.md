*A brief summary of Design Decisions and Works Cited in creating my first personal website as part of the Web Design Decal at UC Berkeley in Fall 2016.*


# Design Decisions:
* Cuprum and Open Sans paring
	*Cuprum is very succint but readable
	*Open Sans is familiar and pretty nice
* Ocean theme
	* I took the photo in Greece in 2012
	* Cool wavy edgy opening animation emulates the sea
	* Original yet not too crazy for a personal site
