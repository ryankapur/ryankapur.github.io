*A brief summary of Design Decisions and Works Cited in creating my first personal website as part of the Web Design Decal at UC Berkeley in Fall 2016.*


## Design Decisions:
* Positioning
	* Fitt's Law
		* Similar buttons are placed adjacent in most logical fashion

* Spacing
	* Simple design
		* No cluttering
	* Utilized Negative space

* Colors
	* Blue and white
	*Utilized opacity to allow user to focus on main content

* Cuprum and Open Sans pairing
	* Cuprum is very succint but readable
	* Open Sans is familiar and pretty nice
* Ocean theme
	* I took the photo in Greece in 2012
	* Cool wavy edgy opening animation emulates the sea
	* Original yet not too crazy for a personal site

##Next Time
* Clean up the code
	* Break up the pieces of code (nav.css, etc.)
	* Seek advice on common practices
	* Learn better JQuery
		* Don't put it in HTML
		* Use .hasClass(), .addClass(), etc.
* Less time animating, more time creating structured code & responsive design
* Figure out how the hell the animation came to be
	* Original idea was to have 'Ryan Kapur' persist after animation but this effect lead me towards an SPA design :)
* Buy a better camera than a Nikon D30 lol
